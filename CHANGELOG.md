### Breaking Changes

- **`boxx` is now `billboard`!** - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/6]
  
  I think it's a much cleaner name and usage is small enough at this point that it doesn't seem too disruptive. This will be the last time the project is renamed ü§û

- **`Billboard::as_str` returns a `String` instead of a `Result<String, VisualWidthError>` - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/5]

  `Billboard` makes more extensive use of `console`'s fancy API which doesn't return any errors, yay!

### Fixes

- **Properly display `Boxx` when content includes ANSI escapes -
  [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/3] [pull/4]**

  A common use case for eventual `Boxx` consumers will be displaying
  boxxed content with colors. Strings include
  [ANSI escapes](http://ascii-table.com/ansi-escape-sequences.php) which are
  then interpreted by terminals. Since there is more information, they require
  more bytes, which means the visual width must be calculated independently from
  the byte width. `Boxx` now strips ANSI escapes from strings when
  calculating the padding and margin for the content.
